## API Docementation
This API facilitate the user interaction with API endpoints via an interface called Swagger.
To access the swagger web interface you could to run an instance of this backend and hit the endpoint of "127.0.0.1/swagger/" if your are using thr regular installation method, but if you are using the docker installation than you have to hit this endpoint "0.0.0.0/swagger/"

## **NOTE**

In this project we have used `pipenv` as our main python virtual environment. So we highly recommand you to use it as your `venv`.
